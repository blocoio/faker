        "It's gonna be really hard waiting 30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.",
        "Jesus, George, it was a wonder I was even born.",
        "Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.",
        "Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model. I didn't have time to build it to scale or paint it.",
        "Let's see if you bastards can do 90.",
        "Look! There's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up.",
        "Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, or anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.",
        "Look, Marvin, you gotta play. See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance. If they can't dance, they can't kiss. If they can't kiss they can't fall in love, and I'm history.",
        "Look, you're not gonna be picking a fight, Dad... Dad-Dad-Daddy-O.",
        "Lorraine. My density has brought me to you.",
        "Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.",
        "Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.",
        "Marty, will we ever see you again?",
        "Maybe you were adopted.",
        "My equipment. That reminds me, Marty. You better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility of overload.",
        "Next saturday night we're sending you back to the future!",
        "No wonder your president has to be an actor. He's gotta look good on television.",
        "No! It requires something with a little more kick...plutonium!",
        "No! Marty! We've already agreed that having information about the future can be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically!",
        "No, get out of town. My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.",
        "No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.",
        "Now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.",
        "Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.",
        "Oh, honey, he's teasing you. Nobody has two television sets.",
        "Oh, my God. They found me. I don't know how, but they found me. Run for it, Marty!",
        "Oh, that's Joey. He cries when we take him out so we just leave him in there.",
        "Oh. One other thing. If you guys ever have kids, and one of them, when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug... go easy on him.",
        "Okay, thank you. That's enough. Hold it now. Hold it. Hold it, fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Bring in the next group, please.",
        "Okay. Time circuit's on. Flux capacitor, fluxing. Engine running. All right.",
        "Perfect! My experiment worked! They're all exactly 25 minutes slow!",
        "Radiation suit? Of course. 'Cause of all the fallout from the atomic wars.",
        "Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads.",
        "Save the clock tower!",
        "Scram, McFly. I'm cuttin' in.",
        "See you in about 30 years.",
        "See you later, Pop. Whoo! Time to change that oil.",
        "Silence, Earthling. My name is Darth Vader. I am an extraterrestrial from the planet Vulcan!",
        "Since when can weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future?",
        "Since you're new here, I-I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So, why don't you make like a tree and get outta here?",
        "So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.",
        "Stand tall, boy. Have some respect for yourself. Don't you know, if you let people walk over you now, they'll be walking over you for the rest of your life. Look at me. You think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?",
        "Stella! Another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car! Come on out here! Help me take him in the house!",
        "Take that, you mutated son of a bitch!",
        "That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?",
        "The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?' You see, Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler! I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at precisely 1:21 a.m. and zero seconds, we shall catch up with him and the time machine.",
        "The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car, why not do it with some style?",
        "There's that word again. 'Heavy.' Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?",
        "Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far the eye could see. Old man Peabody owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.",
        "This is all wrong. I don't know what it is. But when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing... my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?",
        "Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Ah... Are you telling me that you built a time machine... out of a DeLorean?",
        "We're the, uh... We're the Pinheads.",
        "Weight has nothing to do with it.",
        "Well, I figured, what the hell?",
        "Well, you're safe and sound now, back in good old 1955.",
        "What about all that talk about screwing up future events? The space-time continuum?",
        "What are you looking at, butthead?",
        "What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?",
        "What if I send in the tape and they don't like it? I mean, what if they say I'm no good? What if they say 'Get outta here, kid. You got no future'? I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm starting to sound like my old man!",
        "What-what the hell is a gigawatt?",
        "Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?",
        "Who's President of the United States in 1985? Ronald Reagan? The actor? Ha! Then whose vice president? Jerry Lewis?",
        "Whoa. This is heavy.",
        "Whoa. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you trying to tell me that my mother has got the hots for me?",
        "Yeah, well, history is gonna change.",
        "Yes. Yes. I'm George. George McFly. I'm your density. I mean, your destiny.",
        "You caused 300 bucks damage to my car, you son of a bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass.",
        "You got a real attitude problem, McFly; you're a slacker. You remind me of your father when he went here; he was a slacker, too.",
        "You know, Marty, you look so familiar to me. Do I know your mother?",
        "You really think I ought to swear?",
        "You want a Pepsi, pal, you're gonna pay for it.",
        "You're late! Do you have no concept of time?"

          - "I never could bring myself to trust a traitor. Not even a traitor I created."
          - "One must always keep the tools of statecraft sharp and ready. Power and fear - sharp and ready."
          - "I will have Arrakis back for myself! He who controls the Spice controls the universe and what Piter did not tell you is we have control of someone who is very close, very close, to Duke Leto! This person, this traitor, will be worth more to us than ten legions of Sardaukar!"
        piter:
          - "I knew Yueh's wife. I was the one who broke his Imperial conditioning. I've thought of many pleasures with you. It is perhaps better that you die in the innards of a worm. Desire clouds my reason. That is not good. That is bad."
          - "Vendetta, he says, using the ancient tongue. The art of kanly is still alive in the Universe. He does not wish to meet or speak with you."
        alia:
          - "The Guild... they're fighting me in the mental vaults. They're behind everything. They fear the one who will come, who will know more, who will see more. The Guild is behind everything. It's not finished yet. I'm not formed."
        mapes:
          - "Before I do your bidding, manling, I must cleanse the way between us. You've put a water burden on me that I'm not sure I care to support. But we Fremen pay our debts"

          - "When your opponent fears you, then's the moment when you give the fear its own rein, give it the time to work on him. Let it become terror. The terrified man fights himself. Eventually, he attacks in desperation. That is the most dangerous moment, but the terrified man can be trusted usually to make a fatal mistake."
        yueh:
          - "But attack can take strange forms. And you will remember the tooth. The tooth. Duke Leto Atreides. You will remember the tooth."

      sayings:
        bene_gesserit:
          - "I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain."
          - "A world is supported by four things ... the learning of the wise, the justice of the great, the prayers of the righteous and the valor of the brave. But all of these are as nothing ... without a ruler who knows the art of ruling. Make that the science of your tradition!"
          - "The mind can go either direction under stress — toward positive or toward negative: on or off. Think of it as a spectrum whose extremes are unconsciousness at the negative end and hyperconsciousness at the positive end. The way the mind will lean under stress is strongly influenced by training."
          - "Do not count a human dead until you’ve seen his body. And even then you can make a mistake."
          - "Humans must never submit to animals."
          - "To suspect your own mortality is to know the beginning of terror; to learn irrefutably that you are mortal is to know the end of terror."

          - "Prophets have a way of dying by violence."
          - "Humans live best when each has his place to stand, when each knows where he belongs in the scheme of things and what he may achieve. Destroy the place and you destroy the person."

        mentat:
          - "It is by will alone I set my mind in motion. It is by the juice of Sapho that thoughts acquire speed, the lips acquire stains. The stains become a warning."
          - "A process cannot be understood by stopping it. Understanding must move with the flow of the process, must join it and flow with it."
          - "Memory never recaptures reality. Memory reconstructs reality. Reconstructions change the original, becoming external frames of reference that inevitably fail."
        muaddib:
          - "Arrakis teaches the attitude of the knife, chopping off what’s incomplete and saying, \"Now it’s complete because it’s ended here.\""
          - "Greatness is a transitory experience. It is never persistent. It depends in part upon the myth-making imagination of humankind. The person who experiences greatness must have a feeling for the myth he is in. He must reflect what is projected upon him. And he must have a strong sense of the sardonic. This is what uncouples him from belief in his own pretensions. The sardonic is all that permits him to move within himself. Without this quality, even occasional greatness will destroy a man."
          - "There is probably no more terrible instance of enlightenment than the one in which you discover your father is a man — with human flesh."

          - "I am the Kwisatz Haderach. That is reason enough."
          - "The eye that looks ahead to the safe course is closed forever."
          - "Deep in the human unconscious is a pervasive need for a logical universe that makes sense. But the real universe is always one step beyond logic."
          - "There exists no separation between gods and men: one blends softly casual into the other."
          - "There should be a science of discontent. People need hard times and oppression to develop psychic muscles."
        orange_catholic_bible:
          - "Think you of the fact that a deaf person cannot hear. Then, what deafness may we not all possess? What senses do we lack that we cannot see and cannot hear another world all around us?"
          - "When God hath ordained a creature to die in a particular place, He causeth that creature's wants to direct him to that place"
          - "Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a man's mind"
          - "From water does all life begin."

      quotes: [
       "I believe consistency and orthogonality are tools of design, not the primary goal in design.",
       "From the viewpoint of what you can do, therefore, languages do differ - but the differences are limited. For example, Python and Ruby provide almost the same power to the programmer.",
       "The orthogonal features, when combined, can explode into complexity.",
       "I didn't work hard to make Ruby perfect for everyone, because you feel differently from me. No language can be perfect for everyone. I tried to make Ruby perfect for me, but maybe it's not perfect for you. The perfect language for Guido van Rossum is probably Python.",
       "Because of the Turing completeness theory, everything one Turing-complete language can do can theoretically be done by another Turing-complete language, but at a different cost. You can do everything in assembler, but no one wants to program in assembler anymore.",
       "Ruby inherited the Perl philosophy of having more than one way to do the same thing. I inherited that philosophy from Larry Wall, who is my hero actually. I want to make Ruby users free. I want to give them the freedom to choose.",
       "You want to enjoy life, don't you? If you get your job done quickly and your job is fun, that's good isn't it? That's the purpose of life, partly. Your life is better.",
       "People are different. People choose different criteria. But if there is a better way among many alternatives, I want to encourage that way by making it comfortable. So that's what I've tried to do.",
       "In our daily lives as programmers, we process text strings a lot. So I tried to work hard on text processing, namely the string class and regular expressions. Regular expressions are built into the language and are very tuned up for use.",
       "Most of the tasks we do are for humans. For example, a tax calculation is counting numbers so the government can pull money out from my wallet, but government consists of humans.",
       "Actually, I didn't make the claim that Ruby follows the principle of least surprise. Someone felt the design of Ruby follows that philosophy, so they started saying that. I didn't bring that up, actually.",
       "Smart people underestimate the ordinarity of ordinary people.",
       "Language designers want to design the perfect language. They want to be able to say, 'My language is perfect. It can do everything.' But it's just plain impossible to design a perfect language, because there are two ways to look at a language. One way is by looking at what can be done with that language. The other is by looking at how we feel using that language-how we feel while programming.",
       "I believe that the purpose of life is, at least in part, to be happy. Based on this belief, Ruby is designed to make programming not only easy but also fun. It allows you to concentrate on the creative side of programming, with less stress.",
       "Most programs are not write-once. They are reworked and rewritten again and again in their lived. Bugs must be debugged. Changing requirements and the need for increased functionality mean the program itself may be modified on an ongoing basis. During this process, human beings must be able to read and understand the original code. It is therefore more important by far for humans to be able to understand the program than it is for the computer.",
       "I hope to see Ruby help every programmer in the world to be productive, and to enjoy programming, and to be happy. That is the primary purpose of Ruby language.",
       "Man is driven to create; I know I really love to create things. And while I'm not good at painting, drawing, or music, I can write software.",
       "It is not the responsibility of the language to force good looking code, but the language should make good looking code possible.",
       "Plant a memory, plant a tree, do it today for tomorrow.",
       "Imagine you are writing an email. You are in front of the computer. You are operating the computer, clicking a mouse and typing on a keyboard, but the message will be sent to a human over the internet. So you are working before the computer, but with a human behind the computer.",
       "Often people, especially computer engineers, focus on the machines. But in fact we need to focus on humans, on how humans care about doing programming or operating the application of the machines.",
       "Everyone has an individual background. Someone may come from Python, someone else may come from Perl, and they may be surprised by different aspects of the language. Then they come up to me and say, 'I was surprised by this feature of the language, so therefore Ruby violates the principle of least surprise.' Wait. Wait. The principle of least surprise is not for you only.",
       "Sometimes people jot down pseudo-code on paper. If that pseudo-code runs directly on their computers, its best, isn't it? Ruby tries to be like that, like pseudo-code that runs. Python people say that too."

        "Good evening, London. Allow me first to apologize for this interruption. I do, like many of you, appreciate the comforts of every day routine- the security of the familiar, the tranquility of repetition. I enjoy them as much as any bloke. But in the spirit of commemoration, whereby those important events of the past, usually associated with someone's death or the end of some awful bloody struggle, a celebration of a nice holiday, I thought we could mark this November the 5th, a day that is sadly no longer remembered, by taking some time out of our daily lives to sit down and have a little chat. There are of course those who do not want us to speak. I suspect even now, orders are being shouted into telephones, and men with guns will soon be on their way. Why? Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power. Words offer the means to meaning, and for those who will listen, the enunciation of truth. And the truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there? Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression. And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and soliciting your submission. How did this happen? Who's to blame? Well certainly there are those more responsible than others, and they will be held accountable, but again truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror. I know why you did it. I know you were afraid. Who wouldn't be? War, terror, disease. There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense. Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now high chancellor, Adam Sutler. He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent. Last night I sought to end that silence. Last night I destroyed the Old Bailey, to remind this country of what it has forgotten. More than four hundred years ago a great citizen wished to embed the fifth of November forever in our memory. His hope was to remind the world that fairness, justice, and freedom are more than words, they are perspectives. So if you've seen nothing, if the crimes of this government remain unknown to you, then I would suggest you allow the fifth of November to pass unmarked. But if you see what I see, if you feel as I feel, and if you would seek as I seek, then I ask you to stand beside me one year from tonight, outside the gates of Parliament, and together we shall give them a fifth of November that shall never, ever be forgot.",
        "I know there's no way I can convince you this is not one of their tricks, but I don't care, I am me. My name is Valerie, I don't think I'll live much longer and I wanted to tell someone about my life. This is the only autobiography I'll ever write, and god, I'm writing it on toilet paper. I was born in Nottingham in 1985, I don't remember much of those early years, but I do remember the rain. My grandmother owned a farm in Tuttlebrook, and she use to tell me that god was in the rain. I passed my 11th lesson into girl's grammar; it was at school that I met my first girlfriend, her name was Sara. It was her wrists. They were beautiful. I thought we would love each other forever. I remember our teacher telling us that is was an adolescent phase people outgrew. Sara did, I didn't. In 2002, I fell in love with a girl named Christina. That year I came out to my parents. I couldn't have done it without Chris holding my hand. My father wouldn't look at me, he told me to go and never come back. My mother said nothing. But I had only told them the truth, was that so selfish? Our integrity sells for so little, but it is all we really have. It is the very last inch of us, but within that inch, we are free. I'd always known what I wanted to do with my life, and in 2015 I starred in my first film, 'The Salt Flats'. It was the most important role of my life, not because of my career, but because that was how I met Ruth. The first time we kissed, I knew I never wanted to kiss any other lips but hers again. We moved to a small flat in London together. She grew Scarlet Carsons for me in our window box, and our place always smelled of roses. Those were there best years of my life. But America's war grew worse, and worse. And eventually came to London. After that there were no roses anymore. Not for anyone. I remember how the meaning of words began to change. How unfamiliar words like 'collateral' and 'rendition' became frightening. While things like Norse Fire and The Articles of Allegiance became powerful, I remember how different became dangerous. I still don't understand it, why they hate us so much. They took Ruth while she was out buying food. I've never cried so hard in my life. It wasn't long till they came for me. It seems strange that my life should end in such a terrible place, but for three years, I had roses, and apologized to no one. I shall die here. Every inch of me shall perish. Every inch, but one. An Inch, it is small and it is fragile, but it is the only thing the world worth having. We must never lose it or give it away. We must never let them take it from us. I hope that whoever you are, you escape this place. I hope that the world turns and that things get better. But what I hope most of all is that you understand what I mean when I tell you that even though I do not know you, and even though I may never meet you, laugh with you, cry with you, or kiss you. I love you. With all my heart, I love you. -Valerie",
        "Listen to me, Evey. This may be the most important moment of your life. Commit to it. They took your parents from you. They took your brother from you. They put you in a cell and took everything they could take except your life. And you believed that was all there was, didn't you? The only thing you had left was your life, but it wasn't, was it? You found something else. In that cell you found something that mattered more to you than life. It was when they threatened to kill you unless you gave them what they wanted... you told them you'd rather die. You faced your death, Evey. You were calm. You were still. Try to feel now what you felt then.",
        "My fellow Englishmen: tonight our country, that which we stand for, and all we hold dear, faces a grave and terrible threat. This violent and unparalleled assault on our security will not go undefended... or unpunished. Our enemy is an insidious one, seeking to divide us and destroy the very foundation of our great nation. Tonight, we must remain steadfast. We must remain determined. But most of all, we must remain united. Those caught tonight in violation of curfew will be considered in league with our enemy and prosecuted as a terrorist without leniency or exception. Tonight, I give you my most solemn vow: that justice will be swift, it will be righteous, and it will be without mercy.",
        "Our story begins, as these stories often do, with a young up-and-coming politician. He's a deeply religious man and a member of the conservative party. He is completely single-minded convictions and has no regard for the political process. Eventually, his party launches a special project in the name of 'national security'. At first, it is believed to be a search for biological weapons and it is pursued regardless of its cost. However, the true goal of the project is power, complete and total hegemonic domination. The project, however, ends violently... but the efforts of those involved are not in vain, for a new ability to wage war is born from the blood of one of their victims. Imagine a virus - the most terrifying virus you can, and then imagine that you and you alone have the cure. But if your ultimate goal is power, how best to use such a weapon? It is at this point in our story that along comes a spider. He is a man seemingly without a conscience; for whom the ends always justify the means and it is he who suggests that their target should not be an enemy of the country but rather the country itself. Three targets are chosen to maximize the effect of the attack: a school, a tube station, and a water-treatment plant. Several hundred die within the first few weeks. Until at last the true goal comes into view. Before the St. Mary's crisis, no one would have predicted the outcome of the elections. No one. But after the election, lo and behold, a miracle. Some believed that it was the work of God himself, but it was a pharmaceutical company controlled by certain party members made them all obscenely rich. But the true genius of the plan was the fear. A year later, several extremists are tried, found guilty, and executed while a memorial is built to canonize their victims. Fear became the ultimate tool of this government. And through it our politician was ultimately appointed to the newly created position of High Chancellor. The rest, as they say, is history.",
        "Remember, remember, the Fifth of November, the Gunpowder Treason and Plot. I know of no reason why the Gunpowder Treason should ever be forgot... But what of the man? I know his name was Guy Fawkes and I know, in 1605, he attempted to blow up the Houses of Parliament. But who was he really? What was he like? We are told to remember the idea, not the man, because a man can fail. He can be caught, he can be killed and forgotten, but 400 years later, an idea can still change the world. I've witnessed first hand the power of ideas, I've seen people kill in the name of them, and die defending them... but you cannot kiss an idea, cannot touch it, or hold it... ideas do not bleed, they do not feel pain, they do not love... And it is not an idea that I miss, it is a man... A man that made me remember the Fifth of November. A man that I will never forget.",
        "So I read that the former United States is so desperate for medical supplies that they have allegedly sent several containers filled with wheat and tobacco. A gesture, they said, of good will. You wanna know what I think? Well, you're listening to my show, so I will assume you do... I think it's high time we let the colonies know what we really think of them. I think its payback time for a little tea party they threw for us a few hundred years ago. I say we go down to those docks tonight and dump that crap where everything from the Ulcered Sphincter of Arse-erica belongs! Who's with me? Who's bloody with me? Did you like that? USA... Ulcered Sphincter of Arse-erica, I mean what else can you say? Here was a country that had everything, absolutely everything. And now, 20 years later, is what? The world's biggest leper colony. Why? Godlessness. Let me say that again... Godlessness. It wasn't the war they started. It wasn't the plague they created. It was Judgement. No one escapes their past. No one escapes Judgement. You think he's not up there? You think he's not watching over this country? How else can you explain it? He tested us, but we came through. We did what we had to do. Islington. Enfield. I was there, I saw it all. Immigrants, Muslims, homosexuals, terrorists. Disease-ridden degenerates. They had to go. Strength through unity. Unity through faith. I'm a God-fearing Englishman and I'm goddamn proud of it!",
        "Voilà! In view, a humble vaudevillian veteran, cast vicariously as both victim and villain by the vicissitudes of Fate. This visage, no mere veneer of vanity, is a vestige of the vox populi, now vacant, vanished. However, this valorous visitation of a by-gone vexation, stands vivified and has vowed to vanquish these venal and virulent vermin vanguarding vice and vouchsafing the violently vicious and voracious violation of volition. The only verdict is vengeance; a vendetta, held as a votive, not in vain, for the value and veracity of such shall one day vindicate the vigilant and the virtuous. Verily, this vichyssoise of verbiage veers most verbose, so let me simply add that it's my very good honor to meet you and you may call me V."

        "The problem is, he knows us better than we know ourselves. That's why I went to Larkhill, last night.",
        "The time has come for me to meet my maker and to repay him in kind for all that he's done.",
        "Then you have no fear anymore. You're completely free.",
        "There are 872 songs on here. I've listened to them all... but I've never danced to any of them.",
        "There are no coincidences, Delia... only the illusion of coincidence.",
        "There is no court in this country for men like Prothero.",
        "There's no certainty - only opportunity.",
        "This country needs more than a building right now. It needs hope.",
        "This so called V and his accomplice Evey Hammond, neo-demagogues spouting their message of hate, a delusional and aberrant voice delivering a terrorist's ultimatum... An ultimatum that was met with swift, surgically precise justice! The moral of this story ladies and gentleman is... Good guys win, bad guys lose, and as always, England prevails!",
        "Tonight's your big night. Are you ready for it?... Are we ready for it?",
        "Tonight, I will speak directly to these people and make the situation perfectly clear to them. The security of this nation depends on complete and total compliance. Tonight, any protester, any instigator or agitator, will be made example of!",
        "Vi Veri Veniversum Vivus Vici",
        "Violence can be used for good.",
        "Wait! Here comes the crescendo!",
        "We are being buried beneath the avalanche of your inadequacies, Mr. Creedy!",
        "We're oft to blame, and this is too much proved, that with devotion's visage and pious action we do sugar on the devil himself.",
        "We're under siege here, the whole city's gone mad!",
        "What usually happens when people without guns stand up to people with guns.",
        "What was done to me created me. It's a basic principle of the Universe that every action will create an equal and opposing reaction.",
        "What was true in that cell is just as true now. What you felt in there has nothing to do with me.",
        "Who is but the form following the function of what and what I am is a man in a mask.",
        "Why should I trust you?",
        "Would you prefer a lie or the truth?",
        "Yes, Evey. I am V. At last you know the truth. You're stunned, I know. It's hard to believe isn't it, that beneath this wrinkled, well-fed exterior there lies a dangerous killing machine with a fetish for Fawkesian masks. ¡Viva la revolución!",
        "You did what you thought was right.",
        "You got to me? You did this to me? You cut my hair? You tortured me? You tortured me! Why?",
        "You mean, after what you've done? God, what have I done? I Maced that detective. Why did I do that?",
        "You said they were looking for you. If they know where you work, they certainly know where you live.",
        "You said you wanted to live without fear. I wish there'd been an easier way, but there wasn't.",
        "You show me ID, or I'll get Storm Saxon on your ass.",
        "You wear a mask for so long, you forget who you were beneath it.",
        "You were in the cell next to her. That's what it's all about... you're getting back at them for what they did to her... and to you.",
        "You're insane!",
        "You've been formally charged with three counts of murder, the bombing of government property, conspiracy to commit terrorism, treason, and sedition. The penalty for which is death by firing squad. You have one chance and only one chance to save your life. You must tell us the identity or whereabouts of codename V. If your information leads to his capture, you will be released from this facility immediately. Do you understand what I'm telling you? You can return to your life, Miss Hammond. All you have to do is cooperate.",
        "You... it is you!",
        "Your own father said that artists use lies to tell the truth. Yes, I created a lie. But because you believed it, you found something true about yourself.",
        "Your powers of observation continue to serve you well."
